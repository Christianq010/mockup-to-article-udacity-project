Your response goes here!

1.Using atom and structuring a webpage from text has been fun, I can sense this will be the base for me to layer out content on a webpage.
2.HTML hasn't proved to be so difficult yet, other than a few careless mishaps I've found everything so far rather easy.
3.Directory paths and locations proved to be tricky at first , but it makes sense now and found that <hr> style on the last project to be tricky.
4. Yes ! Google search and forums(stack-overflow, github forum) will always be my best friends :D
